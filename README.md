# 2022_Waryah_ZEB1_inhibition

A repository with computational code and outputs to accompany the manuscript Waryah *et al.* (submitted), Synthetic epigenetic reprograming of breast cancer hybrid epithelial to mesenchymal states using the CRISPR/dCas9 platform.

Analysis of the RNA-seq and DNAme data was performed by @jcursons and @MomenehForoutan. Analysis of the RNA-seq data was performed by Dr Christian Pflueger. Please see the code folder for further details.
